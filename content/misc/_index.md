## Colophon / Uses

This website is a meditation on technique and simplicity, and an exercise in taste.

This site is tuned for speed and simplicity. It runs on the static site generator _[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)_ and ships as static files from _[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)_. It uses Stix Two for its heading and the other one for its body add the text here . The site aims to use as little as posivible JavaScript and no frameworks. All fonts and images are stored as is. No analytics and trackers.

### Other sites I run

_[Plankton](https://plankton.bg/)_ (designer & webmaster) — Film streaming and critical essay platform.

_[Lira Gallery](https://gurko45.org/)_ (web designer & webmaster) — Website for Sofia based Gallery Lira.

_[New Degeneration](https://blog.newdegeneration.xyz/)_ (designer & webmaster) — theory-fiction & translation blog.

I also designed and run a small webring for researchers, artists, and other curious people: [Под Нет](https://low-loop.xyz/)

### Odds & ends

The landing page features _[Multi-Scale Turing Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern)_, inspired by [Jonathan McCabe’s paper](http://www.jonathanmccabe.com/Cyclic_Symmetric_Multi-Scale_Turing_Patterns.pdf).  
Multi-scale Turing patterns are computer-generated textures produced by rules for _[reaction–diffusion systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system)_. McCabe’s multi-scale variant runs the diffusion at several neighborhood sizes simultaneously, then cycles their influence. Pieces were generated as a backdrop for a talk titled _"Assemblages and Agency"_ given at _Emmergence Festival_ (2023).
