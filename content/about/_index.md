Nikola Stoyanov is a contemporary visual artist and machine philosopher based in Varna, Bulgaria. He is the author of numerous exhibitions, specializing in photography and digital art exploring the intersections of technology, philosophy, and aesthetics.

His work engages with theory-fiction, post-humanist research, and experimental artistic methodologies, pushing the boundaries of contemporary visual art.

Stoyanovâ€™s artistic practice integrates infrastructure, technological apparatus, and everyday life, merging the humanities with scientific approaches. His practice aims at traversing the boundary between research-based and speculative practices.

In 2025 Nikola Stoyanov co-founded the publishing house ["Temporary Publishing"](https://www.facebook.com/temp.publishing)  along with Hristo Kaloyanov and Filip Stoilov.
